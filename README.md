# ALife
ALife is the name of the researhc project my team and I developed during our time at the Design Research Laboratory(DRL) at the Architectural Association School of Architecture. I specifically focused on developing our computational model at the population scale. I developed a bottom-up communication system between a population of agents to self organize and re organize in to different types of spatial formations. The project was all written in C# in the Unity 3D gaming platform
